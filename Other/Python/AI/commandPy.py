#A program to take command input and perform the correct action
#By Daniel Graham

#sencences are divided into subjects and verbs, these are basically commands.
#To make a program that will interpret senctences and then perform the correct action.
#Object oriented programming. The command will be a method, while the object will be the subject of the sentences.
#Some complications are modifiers like add the following names: or things like that.
#Ideal would have an interface with a thesaurus that can check for synonym names.
