Mary was frustrated and even her best freinds could not help.  Ever since the accidant occured her 
car was just not running properly.  It was especally bad on foggy days when it would hesitate 
and just plain stop.  The insurence company had suggested a garage just accross town and she 
had talked with the cheif mechanic who found a time to work on the car which met her scedule pretty well.
It was beutiful the way things were working out -- it is usually such a challange to find a mechanic who 
will cooporate this much.  Having a knowledgeable insurence agent was a great benifit to her. 
Imagine the suprise
when all the trouble started!  She had a big arguement with the secratary when she couldn't get 
a response to all her calls.  She was especally mad when her car stopped in a busy intersection
-- well it doesn't take much to embarass her.  She wanted imediate attention but there was
no garantee that they were even getting the mesage.  She felt that she had a permanant position
on 'hold' and there was nothing she could do abbout it!
